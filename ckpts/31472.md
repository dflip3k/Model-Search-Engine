The 4th version of the model has been uploaded to huggingface but I'm not certain if it's the original creator of the model</p><p></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://huggingface.co/CluelessC/hll-test/tree/main">https://huggingface.co/CluelessC/hll-test/tree/main</a></p><p></p><p>(it's in working progress right now but I am looking forward to implementing it as the main focus for the future Based mixes)</p><p></p><p>However from Based64 to Based65 this is the finetuned model I used as the base for these mixes, this is version 3</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://huggingface.co/grugger/chubas/resolve/main/models/mirrors/hll3vtubers-last-pruned.safetensors">https://huggingface.co/grugger/chubas/resolve/main/models/mirrors/hll3vtubers-last-pruned.safetensors</a></p><p></p><p>Based64 was made with the most basic of model mixing, from the checkpoint merger tab in the stablediffusion webui,</p><p></p><p>I will upload all the Based mixes onto huggingface so they can be on one directory, Based64 and 65 will have separate pages because Civitai works like that with checkpoint uploads?

Otherwise Based66 will come out soon but I need to look over some models within my mixing recipe and I have to catch up with baking more LORAs and posting their outputs onto <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://linktr.ee/anonymousm">my social media platforms, please support me there if you enjoy my work</a></p>

## Model Versions

### V3

<p>This is pretty much the golden standard of my Based-mixes, or what I've seen people say about it when I was looking at the sidelines. The LORA compatibility with this model is REALLY good</p><p><strong>DOES NOT MEAN YOU SHOULD USE IT AS A MODEL TO TRAIN LORAS, NEVER USE MERGES FOR TRAINING ALWAYS USE NAI'S LEAKED MODEL</strong></p>
