# Noise Offset for True Darkness in SD

#### Civit ID: 10391

<p><strong>Note: 2/27/2023</strong> - I have removed the <strong>ckpt</strong> version of this upload out of an abundance of caution after Bitdefender software reported a Trojan. Spybot Search and Destroy, Malwarebytes, Avast (lol), and Windows Defender (lolol) didn't report any threats. The safetensor version is threat-free in all programs.<br /><br />This model is specially fine-tuned to create good shadowy, dark, scenes. It's created by <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.crosslabs.org/team">Nicholas Guttenberg at Crosslabs</a> and the <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.crosslabs.org/blog/diffusion-with-offset-noise">concept is explained here</a>.<br /><br />Nicholas explains: "not only does SD not have the ability to produce overly dark or light images out of the box, but it also <strong>can’t even learn to do it</strong> - not without changing one thing about it"<br /><br />The article goes on to explain how to finetune your own models with their "darkness" technique, or you can<strong> merge the attached file into your own models with a SD 1.5 diff.</strong> <br /><br />The attached images showcase the difference between their Noise Offset trained 1.5 model and the original 1.5 model, and the results are striking - true darkness and good contrast is possible with this model/method. I've also included examples of the model merged into my <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/3848/theallys-mix-ii-churned">Churned Mix</a> - producing true black/dark images.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/8765/theovercomer8s-contrast-fix-sd15sd21-768">This amazing LoRA</a> has implemented the technique described in Crosslab's paper.<br /><br /><strong>Please consider joining my Patreon</strong>!
