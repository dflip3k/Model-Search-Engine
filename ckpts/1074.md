<p>I played a lot in my childhood at laser disc videogames so this model is my personal tribute to the great Disney animator Don Bluth.This is a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model (based on v1.5), I've trained three different models from videogames laser disc Dragon's Lair , Space Ace and Dragon's Lair II Time Warp then I merged these models into a single one called dbluth. Use the token <em>dbluth</em> in your prompts to use the style. <em>Download the ckpt file from "files and versions" tab into the stable diffusion models folder of your web-ui of choice.</em> The model is pretty similar to Disney classic model because of course Don Bluth was one of the main animator in classic Disney era. <em>I've found interesting the output in the img2img generation. You can see the results in the second image (original/img2img).</em></p><p><a href="https://huggingface.co/tuwonga/dbluth" rel="ugc" target="_blank">https://huggingface.co/tuwonga/dbluth</a></p>
