<p>Hello everyone! My third and no where near final model. Today I have two new ones, another one I'll be uploading in a bit but this one first for now. First off, thanks for the support on the last model. But enough shameless thanks. Lets get on to da good stuff!</p><p></p><p>First off, this is yet another mix going for a semi realistic look. But this one is better. It is very good with faces, I'm gonna get that off to you right now. It is extremely good as well with details and all that fluff. However, the colors are VERY flat on this one, if you want just add: (saturated, popping colors:0.7) to lighten up the photo a bit. Its ok with NSFW. Unlike my last mix. Anyways I mixed it with a custom mix, but basically the gist is:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>AOMA3 (25%), AmborsiaFusion (25%), and Counterfiet2.5 (50% for that realistic goodness. </p></li></ul><p>Below is the recommended settings for BMM.</p><ul><li><p>CFG Scale 10.</p></li><li><p>Steps Test: 20. Illustration: 30.</p></li><li><p>Upscaler <s>Latent </s> <em><u>Your pick</u></em></p></li><li><p>Sampler DPM +++ SDE Karras</p></li><li><p>Prompts: Can be semi advanced, the CFG scale factors this a lot. </p></li><li><p>Negative prompts: Simple is best, here is the recommended negative prompt: "(worst quality, low quality:1.4), EasyNegative, bad_prompt_version2, disfigured, shallow eyes, fractured eyes." </p></li></ul><p>Anyways. below is photos using all of these steps right here above. Just to show how good this model is. (Steps in the photos.) If it randomly generates nsfw, put nsfw first in the negative prompts if going for a SFW image. All images shown below are also from the first image I got with using this prompt, no minute long redoing, just straight to the point. (No inpainting as well,)</p>
