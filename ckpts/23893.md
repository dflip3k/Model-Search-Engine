# Product Design (minimalism-eddiemauro)

#### Civit ID: 23893

<p>Hi, I’m product and car designer, and I’m so excited to test with AI, I think is a good tool for designing. This tool is so useful for the design process (shapes-ideas generation), but more than that it helps so much to refine aesthetically. If you want to support my work and help me to upload more models (with better quality), you can do it by entering here and donating, I would greatly appreciate it:</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://ko-fi.com/eddiemauro">https://ko-fi.com/eddiemauro</a></p><p></p><p><strong>ORIGINAL MODEL:</strong> eddiemauro 1.5. Express the minimalism concept. Matte finishing.</p><p><strong>VARIANT MODEL:</strong> eddiemauro 1.5b. The prompt is more precise, and it adapts better with objects, but minimalism style is less. The object shape is more realistic, so I consider the original model is more "creative". Also, is less matte. (also known as eddiemauro3.5).</p><p><strong>VARIANT MODEL v.2:</strong> eddiemauro 2. The prompt is more precise, and it adapts better with objects than original and first variant mode, but the minimalism style is less. The object shape is more realistic, so I consider the original model is more "creative". It is more matte when you apply hires.fix and img2img mode. It is more colorful, and It tends to have sometimes a weird color combination. </p><p></p><p>After a lot of training and testing images, I finally arrived at a stable model to generate product design images and iterations. Even that I’m trying to enhance it. Recommendation to use this model:<br /></p><ol><li><p>It is mandatory to use captions in the prompt like: “3D product render”, “product render” or "3D product render style". I’m testing to enhance model using another “instance token”, probably I will change it, but it depends on the quality of image generation. I use this token especially to enhance “product rendering” captions and center it to a certain style, also I think that can be merged with another Lora Style. Even that, I’m not so expert with training, and I will try with a different name if results get better.</p></li><li><p>Clip Skip 2. Go to settings-Stable Diffusion-Clip Skip, and put “2”. I trained model with this option.</p></li><li><p>Generate first some images by changing “Batch size”, select one, and go to img2img mode, duplicate or increase resolution (image size), with “denoise strength” of “0.3 to 0.5”. It is the same process of “hires.fix” in txt2img mode, but you can have more images generated to select. Try to preserve 512x512 (or just 512 in one side) because images are trained at this resolution, and when you change it the model-shapes start gets crazy, even that you can experiment. </p></li><li><p>It is highly recommended to use "hires.fix" with a denoise of 0.5-0.7, using "UltraSharp" upscale model.</p></li><li><p>Use new “extra tool” for enhancing image called “4x-UltraSharp”, to increase final resolution. If you want to have more detail, use "4x_NMKD-Siax_200k" or "4x-UniScaleV2_Moderate".</p></li><li><p>When you feel there is a color extra in the image, just put it in Negative prompt space. Try to put "EasyNegative" embedding in the first part and also in the last part of the prompt because the generation change.</p></li><li><p>If you combine the model using Lora like “<strong>epi_noiseoffset</strong>”, you can generate another kind of images with a little style, but trained style will decrease.</p></li><li><p>Use ControlNet to generate a more controlled shape of what you want, and even <strong>you can test it with sketches</strong>. Some images shown here were created with projects that I have done, if you like, you can take like a base one of my creations: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.behance.net/eadesign1"><u>https://www.behance.net/eadesign1</u></a></p></li><li><p>You can use this model for whatever you want. If there is another app that is using my model, and you have to pay for it, just let me know. If you use it for merge, I would just ask to contact me.</p></li><li><p>You can download “EasyNegative” embedding and use it.</p></li><li><p>Use VAE 560000 or 840000 of SD model 1.5, to enhance the image created. Sometimes works. For 1.5b model is mandatory. It <span style="color:rgb(193, 194, 197)">enhances mostly the contrast and color.</span></p><p></p></li></ol><p><br />The sample images here were created with my model, and it has not any inpainting or post-production, just were upscaled with A111 models. You have to consider that you have to experiment so much to arrive at these results because it is hard to test just once and get an ideal result. I use Automatic1111 with most used extensions. I tried with Lora also, but I prefer Dreambooth normal because it is more precise.</p><p></p><p>I trained this model with 100 images with a “minimalistic” style (probably I will train more styles). 75% were products and 22% transportation, from that most of these are speakers, smart robots, water bottles, and others. I will enhance the models by adding 100 more images with a variety of shapes and different types. I realized that these models work so well in vehicle-car shapes, even that if were not so many vehicles in the training dataset.</p><p><br /><strong>Example Prompt:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Positive prompt: </strong>3D product render, futuristic water bottle, finely detailed, purism, ue 5, a computer rendering, minimalism, octane render, 4k</p><p><strong>Negative prompt:</strong> EasyNegative, (worst quality:2), (low quality:2), (normal quality:2), lowres, ((monochrome)), ((grayscale)), cropped, text, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, sketch, cartoon, drawing, anime, duplicate, blurry, semi-realistic, out of frame, ugly, deformed</p><ul><li><p>Steps, from 20-40 (For EulerA is enough 20, and you can use also DPM++SDE Karras, but EulerA is better mostly)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>CFG scale: 6-9 (Going for 10-15, to less style, but more realistic shape of object).</p></li></ul><p></p><p>You can follow me on my social networks. I will show my process and also design tips and tools:</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.facebook.com/eddiemauro.design"><u>https://www.facebook.com/eddiemauro.design</u></a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.instagram.com/eddiemauro.design/"><u>https://www.instagram.com/eddiemauro.design/</u></a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddiemauro/"><u>https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddiemauro/</u></a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.behance.net/eadesign1"><u>https://www.behance.net/eadesign1</u></a></p><p><br /></p>

### eddiemauro1.5

<p>.safetensor file, is the original one that I used to train. .ckpt file I converted it from A1111, I tested it and seems to be the same (is strange, because sometimes I feel safetensor one is better), but just in case is not the original one.</p>
