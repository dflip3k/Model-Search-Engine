# Illuminutty Diffusion

#### Civit ID: 36152

<p><strong>Update (April 12th, 2023)</strong>: Apparently this model barely works without a set of embeds. Anyway, here's all of them. As with the checkpoint, it was licensed to me and I'm free to redistribute it. But even if you disagree: different name, different hash == different embeds.</p><p></p><p>Have fun.</p><p></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://files.catbox.moe/0gjduq.zip">https://files.catbox.moe/0gjduq.zip</a></p><p>--</p><p>You may notice a distinct similarity in the output this model generates with a model that was formerly available named 'Illuminati Diffusion'. That is because the weights and configs are identical. However, <strong>this is not Illuminati Diffusion v11</strong>. That name has been exclusively licensed to one of those shitty SaaS generation services.</p><p>In addition, although the weights and configs <em>are</em> identical, the hashes of the files <em>are</em> different. Therefore: different name, different hash, different model.</p><p>But still, let's make two things very clear:</p><ol><li><p>Weights and configuration files are not copyrightable, and;</p></li><li><p>Even if they were, the weights and models were downloaded by me (and thousands of others) under the <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/CompVis/stable-diffusion-license">creativeml-openrail-m</a> license.</p></li></ol><p>That license grants me:</p><p><em>a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Complementary Material, the Model, and Derivatives of the Model.</em></p><p>And no, adding a blurb to the model page that no-one reads does not, in fact, constitute a modification of the license that you uploaded under, or amend the terms of service you were subject to when you uploaded it.</p><p>Given the above, I republished a wholly new work containing the original weights. You're now free to use this wildly overtrained model for any purpose you like. I suggest using it as an example of the need for ground truth datasets in training.</p>
