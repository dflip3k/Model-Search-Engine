# Women standing in their panties

#### Civit ID: 1543

<p>This model uses <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/1173/hassanblend-all-versions">Hassan 1.4</a> as the base and was fine tuned on about 300 images of women standing barefoot in their underwear from a lingerie shopping site.</p><p>It will generally render legs and feet better than other models, all else being equal.</p><p>Although none of the images it was trained on are nude, it's perfectly capable of producing nudes. Due to the theme of the images here, I'm marking the model as NSFW though there are countless better models out there for producing nudes, while this one is specifically for beautiful women in beautiful panties.</p><p>To get started, you can try the following settings (and tweaking them accordingly):</p><p><strong>Recommended Starting Settings -</strong></p><p><strong>Note: This model is very sensitive to its prompts, esp the trigger. Try using the default prompt and the ones used to generate the sample images before complaining if you're not getting good results.</strong></p><p><strong>(Note: after the recent update, use an initial resolution of 384x768, an upscaling factor of 1.33333, and an upscaler of Latent.)</strong></p><p><strong>Prompt</strong>: barefoot woman standing in her panties</p><p><strong>Height</strong>: 1024</p><p><strong>Width</strong>: 512</p><p><strong>Sampler</strong>: Euler A</p><p><strong>Highres fix</strong>: On, denoising = 0.5</p><p><strong>Steps</strong>: 20</p><p><strong>CFG</strong>: 7.5</p><p>Sometimes, it'll produce women with unnaturally long bodies and/or legs. If it happens frequently with your particular prompt, I recommend adding any of the following to your Negative Prompt:</p><ul><li><p>[long legs]</p></li><li><p>[skinny]</p></li><li><p>[tall]</p></li></ul><p>It's important to wrap them in these brackets, [], so that they don't overtake the negative prompt. For example, not wrapping [skinny] in brackets may result in obese or overweight women.</p><p>For more tips on how to create beautiful women using SD (not just with this model), I've written a guide <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://rentry.org/sd_beautiful_women">here</a>.</p>

## Model Versions

### 1.1

<p>This is a retrain of my model but on <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/1276/dreamlike-photoreal">Dreamlike Photoreal</a>. (Please see their terms if you want to use this or a model you train off of it commercially.) Anyways, after hearing that F222 was supposedly trained on only 11 images in Dreambooth, I decided to try retraining my model again using the 11 most distinct images of the original dataset. The facial quality wasn't as great so I added another 11 faces that I handpicked.</p><p>The prompt I trained this model on is: <strong>barefoot woman standing in her panties</strong>, but you don't necessarily have to use that to get similar results as the example pictures since it can be a bit awkward to put into some long and creative prompts. Just mention several of the keywords from the phrase and you should still get decent results. If the faces aren't great, add <strong>hot face</strong> to your prompt, i.e. <strong>barefoot woman standing in her panties, hot face </strong>which will increase focus on the face (but decrease focus on other parts as a tradeoff.)</p><p><strong>(Note: after the recent update, use an initial resolution of 384x768, an upscaling factor of 1.33333, and an upscaler of Latent.)</strong></p>
