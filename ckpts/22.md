# Pixel Art Sprite Diffusion

#### Civit ID: 22

<p><strong>IF YOU ARE THE CREATOR OF THIS MODEL PLEASE CONTACT US TO GET IT TRANSFERRED TO YOU!</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Created by u/-Olorin</p><p>This Stable diffusion checkpoint allows you to generate pixel art sprite sheets from four different angles. These first images are my results after merging this model with another model trained on my wife. merging another model with this one is the easiest way to get a consistent character with each view. still requires a bit of playing around with settings in img2img to get them how you want. for left and right, I suggest picking your best result and mirroring. after you are satisfied take your photo into photoshop or Krita, remove the background, and scale to the desired size. after this you can scale back up to display your results; this also clears up some of the color murkiness in the initial outputs.
