# Species

#### Civit ID: 17564

<h1>Species</h1><p>This model is mostly an experiment to see if I could add various concepts that I wanted into the base model. I think it worked well enough so I'm sharing in case anyone else also wants those things</p><p>trained at 768x768 using EveryDream2</p><h3>concepts included:</h3><ul><li><p>"Centaur" and "x taur" (where x is some animal, "deer", "cat", etc), both of these work really well across multiple styles and characters, although you will occasionally get a horse or a mutant</p></li><li><p>"slime girl" (or "boy", "woman", etc.) also works very consistently</p></li><li><p>"Klingon" works very well, "bat'leth" is in there but sucks.</p></li><li><p>"Twi'lek" works well, but messes up the head tails about as often as it does arms</p></li><li><p>"Trill" works okay, but tends to add spots in the wrong places, probably needed more training</p></li><li><p>"genie" works okay, but sometimes just gives a middle eastern person, which is cringe</p></li><li><p>"Ferengi", gets the head shape good, but faces are a bit weird</p></li><li><p>"Asari" works really well, does men fine even though there were none in training data</p></li><li><p>"Dryad" was something the model kinda knew already, but I think it's better now</p></li><li><p>"Satyr" works pretty well, occasionally it thinks "centaur" for no reason I understand</p></li><li><p>"Cardassian" works nicely</p></li><li><p>"Drider" works, but tends to render far away to show the spider's body, so faces need fixing</p></li><li><p>"Tortle" is good, "ninja tortle" does too ;)</p></li><li><p>it's silly but I added "foodfolk" in</p></li><li><p>"Myconid" generally works, although it wants to just do people with mushroom hats a lot</p></li><li><p>"gorgon" is alright. sometimes it even gets the snake heads kinda okay. wants them to be screaming, so I should have labeled facial expressions better. added a bit of "naga" as well, and the two mix well</p></li><li><p>"ghost" was already in there, but is a bit better trained now</p></li><li><p>"harpy" works sometimes, although I'm not super happy with it, same for "sphinx"</p></li><li><p>"giant x" works pretty well given context, like "walking in a tiny city" or "in the mountains"</p></li><li><p>"tiny x" works sometimes, but is inconsistent. definitely needs context. "trapped in a jar" or "on a giant table" work fairly well</p></li><li><p>"transformation sequence" I added on a lark, and wasn't expecting it to work well. It doesn't exactly work well, but it's better than I expected. "transformation sequence, man into woman" works the best, but "transformation sequence, x into y" is the format and sometimes works for whatever. "3-part" likewise works most consistently, but you can make it a long image and do a larger "x-part" too. you'll almost definitely need to fix some details (especially faces)</p></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>feedback welcome! I'll be doing more versions with more species I think, so let me know which ones you want the most</strong></p>

## Model Versions

### v0.5

<p>still based on deliberate. version 0.4 was based off of 1.5 but I wasn't happy with my results, so I didn't bother publishing. will try again probably</p><p>took out the overwatch characters, those will probably get their own model at some point</p><p></p><p>added:</p><ul><li><p>"Ferengi", gets the head shape good, but faces are a bit weird</p></li><li><p>"Asari" works really well, does men fine even though there were none in training data</p></li><li><p>"Dryad" was something the model kinda knew already, but I think it's better now</p></li><li><p>"Satyr" works pretty well, occasionally it thinks "centaur" for no reason I understand</p></li><li><p>"Cardassian" works nicely</p></li><li><p>"Drider" works, but tends to render far away to show the spider's body, so faces need fixing</p></li><li><p>"Tortle" is good, "ninja tortle" does too ;)</p></li><li><p>it's silly but I added "foodfolk" in</p></li><li><p>"Myconid" generally works, although it wants to just do people with mushroom hats a lot</p></li><li><p>"gorgon" is alright. sometimes it even gets the snake heads kinda okay. wants them to be screaming, so I should have labeled facial expressions better. added a bit of "naga" as well, and the two mix well</p></li><li><p>"ghost" was already in there, but is a bit better trained now </p></li><li><p>"harpy" works sometimes, although I'm not super happy with it, same for "sphinx"</p></li></ul>

[Model Version v0.5](https://civitai.com/api/download/models/25724)

### v0.3

<p>Added an extracted LORA file, for flexibility. it does lose some fidelity, as expected. probably best to use vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned, as that was baked into the model I trained on.</p><p>Next version I'll just start training from 1.5 and I think that'll make it more portable</p>
