You can also use danbooru style tags for characters (1girl, brown hair, etc.).</p><p>Non-square aspect ratios work better for some prompts. If you want a portrait photo, try using a 3:4 or a 9:16 aspect ratio. If you want a landscape photo, try using a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p><p><strong>License</strong></p><p>This model is licesed under a <strong>modified</strong> CreativeML OpenRAIL-M license.</p><ul><li><strong>You can't host the model or its derivatives on websites/apps/etc., from which you earn, or plan to earn revenue.
