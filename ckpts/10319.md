# Gay621 Solo Male Focus

#### Civit ID: 10319

<p>This is intended to be a semi specialized solo gay male pinup / character creator. If you are looking for a model strong at generating females, this is not it lol. It is able to create multiple character images, but that's not what it's ideal for. There is currently another project I'm working on which will be better suited for that. This models ideal range is femboy to twunk. See testing prompt for a good place to start.<br /><br />Early version, still lots of work to do, but does not re-use any previous furry or yiffy models, which always messed up the pps (uwu). <br /><br />Trained various combinations of around 120,000 male gay focused furry images, for use with stable diffusion web UI. <br /><br />Tagging uses comma separated e-621 options without any underscores. <br /><br />Exception to tags: YMMV, but underscores are still needed when specifying a specific character tags and MetaTags. Meta tags are preserved as well, and continue to use underscores.<br /><br />IE: Vincent_(FoxMcC) on e621 would be represented as Vincent_\(FoxMcC\) in this model. <br /><br />IE: hi_res and digital_media_(artwork) on e621 would be hi_res, digital_media_\(artwork\) <br /><br />Artist tags will usually work okay with just the name, but you'll have the best luck prefixing them with 'by' IE: by chunie, by richard foley, etc.<br /><br /><br />Be VERY SPECIFIC with what you want in an image with this, down to specifying eye color. See sample prompt. It is intended to be more of a character or pinup generator, but it's able to do well with multiple characters as well with careful sculpting. <br /><br />Some kinks are not represented in the model, images which were tagged with the following are not included in the image training dataset -animated -human<em>only -hyper -watersports -scat -cub -comic -diaper -pixel</em>(artwork) -3d_(artwork) -vore -chibi <br /><br />This isn't because I have anything against those kinks, rather I'm trying to create a slight built-in bias or remove unexpected elements from the images it generates.<br /><br />The criteria to be included in the training was a favcount greater than 200 and a score over 100, which also contain the tags 'anthro' and 'male'<br /><br />Note: Specifying the number of fingers you want helps immensely, and put your most important criteria at the front of the prompt, and nice to haves near the back. <br /><br /><br />Testing configuration /prompts <br />Euler A - 28 (Heun 30 usually is an interesting vatiation) <br />CFG 8 (works well between 6 and 9 depending on the prompt)<br />Seed - 855213688 (you can set it to whatever but this is what I test with) <br /><br />Optional Hires testing configuration <br />Upscaler - Latent (nearest) <br />Denoising strength 0.6 <br />Upscale 2 <br /><br />Positive Prompt: <br />wolf, wolfdog, striped hyena, anthro, male, detailed, (detailed fur), (athletic), athletic anthro, muscular, muscular anthro, muscular male, fluffy, fluffy fur, fluffy ears, fluffy hair, fluffy chest, mane, pinup, canine ears, canine penis, canine anatomy, chest tuft, (balls), big balls, nude, nude male, solo, (fully sheathed), (penis tip), thigh up, (yellow eyes), ((sheath)), (white sheath), (black sheath), (brown sheath), tan sheath, gray sheath, retracted sheath, smug, grin, horny, lustful gaze, [orange fur], [red fur], [white fur], [blue fur], [yellow fur], two tone fur, two tone body, two tone hair, multi tone hair, sitting, posing, reclining, detailed background, five fingers, rating:explicit, digital_media_\(artwork\) <br /><br />Negative Prompt: <br />deformed, blurry, multi limb, taur, multiple limbs, bad anatomy, disfigured, poorly drawn face, mutated, extra limb, ugly, woman, female, multiple characters, feral, deformed hands, face out of frame, multiple tails, over saturated, hdr, high dynamic range, sketch, comic, human penis, no pupils, simple background, multiple characters, cub, child, jock, underwear, clothing, chastity, cage, abstract, chastity cage<br /><br />Possible future testing versions can be found in Furry Diffusion discord or at <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://wolf.gay/">https://wolf.gay/</a><br /><br />No commercial for profit use of any kind, or selling images made by this model, or any derivations of this model / images created by them. <br /><br /></p>
