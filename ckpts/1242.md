<p>Originally posted to <a href="https://huggingface.co/ArtistsJourney/PareidoliaGateway" rel="ugc" target="_blank">HuggingFace by ArtistsJourney</a></p><p>"Introducing 'Pareidolia Gateway,' the first custom AI model trained on the illustrations from my cosmic horror graphic novel of the same name. This model is my contribution to the potential of AI-generated art, while also honoring the work of traditional artists.</p><p>As a traditional artist myself, I understand the fear and skepticism that comes with the rise of AI in the art world. But I believe that, with the exponential advancements of AI, we can use it as a tool to elevate and deepen our passion for storytelling, regardless of the medium we choose to express ourselves.</p><p>With 'Pareidolia Gateway,' I want to provide a platform for traditional artists and promptists to come together and explore the possibilities of AI-enhanced art. This model is trained on my own personal traditional art, and is available under the Creative Commons Attribution license, allowing others to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon my work. I hope that it will serve as a source of inspiration and guidance for others.</p><p>I also want to stress that the use of AI in art does not have to mean the death of traditional art. In fact, I believe that it can help us to better understand and appreciate the beauty and value of traditional art, and add a new dimension to our collective consciousness.</p><p>So, don't be afraid to experiment with AI-generated art. It’s up to us how we can shift the trajectory for good instead of pushing against it. Let’s embrace it as a tool that can help you create more engaging and powerful work. And remember, the key to creating great art is to nurture your own unique style and vision in a way that speaks to You.</p><p>To read and order my book ‘Pareidolia Gateway,’ visit: <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Pareidolia-Gateway-Wilfred-Lee/dp/1728303273" rel="ugc" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.ca/Pareidolia-Gateway-Wilfred-Lee/dp/1728303273</a></p>
